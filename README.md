amBXPeripheralController (aPC)
================

aPC consists of a server and a few client applications, which allow you to control a set of amBX gaming peripherals.  Currently only tested against the Philips amBX kit.

The server runs in the background and handles communication through the amBX API.  The clients use WCF to communicate with the server itself.
